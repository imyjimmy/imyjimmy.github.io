Belonging to a family means having indirect involuntary exposure to ideas good and bad: 

* Your uncle might be a dogecoin degen.
* Your (distant) relatives are asking your parents for money--they are always "starting a business" or asking them to fund their next idea
* An entire branch of your family are full of accomplished engineers and artists

One could make a graph. It would be bidirectional:
* edges are weighted
* positive influences are positive numbers
* negative influences are negative numbers
* multiplying force by how much time each node spends w other nodes

You could totally navigate your family by--
* traversing the edges, finding nodes
* developing stronger ties with the positive nodes
* rationing negative ties / strategically send back positive energy

Your family is a built in insurance policy against rainy days. This was evolutionarily beneficial.
* contribute to the rainy day bucket during ordinary times
* draw from the bucket during trying times

The fam has to have a verification mechanism to guard against fraud--this is what culture / religion is for.

Does this mean over time culture converges?

Ok, but where do black sheep go? Why do biological family have black sheep--what is the advantage there (from an evolution standpoint?) Not clear, but they _should_ have all died off. There should be no black sheep of the family.

Unless. Black sheep are there to guard against groupthink.

As an aside--
Individuals are so revered in modern American culture, yet human beings are basically wired to be the same / overwhemlingly group-thinking, socially bound by rules of family/religion type people. Like who really is uniquely individual? Every "Successful Individual" drives a lambo...

We worship individuals but talented individuals self-aggregate and come from a collective pool of other talented individuals. All tech bros know each other. Same with comedians. Musicians seem to self-select.

No man is an island, but when you pee, you're a nation.

Family tries very hard to make you one of them. If you think/act too differently you should lose your privilege of accessing family resources. The trick is to **be yourself** while being part of the group.

To be continued...
